My first forked repository of a great WordPress development Udemy Course. Some of the information was generated using ChatGPT 4. The [functions](/docs/php_functions_and_wordpress.md) covered in the course will be added as I learn along in the course. The purpose of this repository is to serve as a reference for future projects. I'm hoping to see this project through, juggling my time between this project and my full-time job as a commercial truck driver. I also hope this information will be useful to those who are interested in learning about WordPress and are enrolled in the course.
